## Running it

`build.zip` should have the most recent stable build. Simply unzip it and drag it into chrome://extensions (turn on Developer Mode first) to run.

## Internal Development

Run `npm i` to update/install all dependencies. Note that you need nodeJS installed.

To host just the popup part of the Chrome Extension, run `npm start`. (Note: This lacks most of the native chrome api functionality, so storage updates may have unexpected behavior.)

For typical building, run `npm run build` or `npm run build watch` if you want a new build every time you update a file.

To get the full, optimized production build (minified, without source maps, and linted), run `npm run build prod`. This also generates a build.zip file.

You can also run `npm run build prod watch` to get linting in every new build (occurs every time you update a file). (WARNING: slow! It's recommended that you have a built-in linter anyways.)

To run any of the builds generated by the above methods, simply load the `build` folder into chrome://extensions as an Unpacked Extension (make sure Developer Mode is on).

### Things to do when doing translation site config

- make sure it works on all screen sizes (it might use different elements)
- multiple output translations?
- Make sure weird input (like new lines and blank trailing/leading spaces) behave correctly in request (and sanitize it if it doesnâ€™t)
- Add host permission to manifest.json (for capturing network requests if relevant)

### Other notes

Use the `classnames` package when you have multiple/conditional class names.
Use logger.ts rather than console.log for debugging (So it doesn't appear in prod.) If you want to see these logs, set `debug` to true in storage using something like `await chrome.storage.local.set({debug:true})` in either the popup or service worker inspect element windows and reload the extension.
